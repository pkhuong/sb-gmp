GMP integration for SBCL

This is still work in progress though mostly usable. For minor quirks refer to the NOTEs in the source.

Roadmap

- add ratio support (mostly ready though not committed yet)
- unit tests
- benchmarks to find out heuristics for when to switvh to the GMP functions
- transparently integrate into SBCL using previous heuristics
